# MESSENGER 2.0

## SCOPE
This is just a basic project to learn how to use react and nodejs with the addition of socket.io to pass information between the two, and also to create a fun react app! not going to be optimised for anything, may look to host this app to learn more about hosting react apps.

## DESCRIPTION
Using a ReactJS Front End with a Node.js backend with socket.io to create an awesome instant messaging app.
